The procedure for making a 1M TRIS buffer solution at pH 7.2 is as follows:

1.	Prepare 0.8 liters of distilled water in a suitable container.
2.	Add 121.14 grams of Tris base to the solution.
3.	Adjust solution to desired pH using HCl (typically pH â‰ˆ 7.2).
4.	Q.S. with distilled water until the volume is 1 liters.

The batch quantity of this TRIS buffer can be scaled up or down by multiplying all quantities by the desired final volume in liters.

Standard Operating Procedure Euthanasia of RodentsPurpose The purpose of this document is to establish uniform procedures for the proper methods  to euthanize animals while minimizing discomfort, distress, and pain. This SOP contains  direction developed solely to provide internal guidance to employees  Scope This SOP applies to all staff members. Personnel Qualifications/Responsibilities/Authority 1. The VP has authority in directing and establishing this SOP. 2. The Director  is responsible for maintaining this SOP. 3. The Manager  is responsible for the implementation, enforcing  and training of SOP material to all associated staff members. 4. All staff members associated with the vivarium operation are responsible for  familiarizing themselves with this SOP prior to the execution of their duties. Definitions Euthanasia: or literally, “good death” – is the act of terminating a life while minimizing  or eliminating pain or distress. According to the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of  Animals (2020 ed.) the primary objective regarding euthanasia of an animal is “(1) their  humane disposition to induce death in a manner that is in accord with an animal’s interest  and/or because it is a matter of welfare, and (2) the use of humane techniques to induce  the most rapid and painless and distress-free death possible.” The chosen method of  euthanasia should result in “the rapid loss of consciousness followed by cardiac or  respiratory arrest and, ultimately, a loss of brain function.”  AVMA: American Veterinary Medical Association Exsanguination: Severe loss of blood due to internal or external hemorrhage Equipment and Materials ● Compressed CO2 gas cylinder/ house gas equipped with an EZ-Systems  euthanex Prodigy unit attached. ● Disposal or carcass bag ● Euthanasia chamber with Euthanex lid ● Any tools required to perform secondary method of euthanasia ● Proper PPE Step by Step Procedure 1. If using CO2 delivered by a gas cylinder, confirm that the tank has enough gas  available.  2. Collect cages of animals intended for euthanasia and delivery them to the  procedure room where euthanasia is permitted 1. Do not euthanize animals in animal holding rooms or in sight of other  animals unless is special approved circumstances such as quarantine or  exposure to infectious agents 2. Perform euthanasia in a biosafety cabinet when euthanizing BSL2 cages 3. Euthanasia of more than one animal should always be performed in  cohorts of live animals (live animals must never be placed in a chamber  with dead animals) 3. Use animal home cage as euthanasia cage when possible. If the home cage is not  possible, use an appropriately sized cage, and freshly sanitized chamber.  Minimum floor space requirements as listed in the “Guide” must be met for all  rodents at all times. 4. Place Euthanex lid on top of the euthanasia chamber such that holes in the lid are  over the cage to allow displacement of air. If using home cage, remove the filter  lid prior to placement of the Euthanex lid. 5. Turn on CO2  6. The Euthanex Smart Box Prodigy System will be used when performing  euthanasia of rodents. Turn the system on by depressing the power switch on the  back of the Smart Box. 7. The Prodigy system will be programmed by the Manager or designee,  with cage dimensions and the flow rate will be calculated by the system  automatically. CO2 occurs at a displacement rate of 30-70% chamber volume per  minute (approximately 1-3L per minute) to avoid delivering the gas at a high  velocity causing pain and distress to the animals. This system allows for up to three cages of animals to be euthanized concurrently.  The touch screen display shows the cycle, cycle time, and total time remaining.  1. Follow the onscreen prompts to begin the process. 1. Press mouse cage 2. Press the number of cages (1-3)3. Press start 2. The system will “charge” - slowly begin filling the cage with CO2 for five  minutes.  3. Prefilling the CO2 chamber is not accepted - as sudden exposure to high  concentrations of CO2 may be distressing to some species 8. Allow CO2 to flow at the desired rate, gas concentration may be increased as loss  of consciousness is observed and flow should be maintained 1 minute after  apparent clinical death (i.e.., cessation of cardiovascular and respiratory  movement)  1. Animals are not to be left unattended during euthanasia procedures 9. Once complete, observe the animals for any movements and/or breathing (some  animals will take longer than others to expire). Once the animals are unconscious  and have stopped breathing you will perform an approved secondary form of  euthanasia such as: cervical dislocation, decapitation or thoracotomy and as  dictated by the client’s protocol or IACUC. 10. Turn off CO2    11. Chambers and lids must be sanitized between animals or groups of animals    Neonates: 12. The use of sharp scissors for decapitation is recommended for euthanasia of  neonatal rodents up to 7 days of age.  13. Neonates: (up until approximately 10 days) are resistant to CO2 euthanasia due to  their inherent resistance to hypoxia and may require prolonged exposure time to  any type of inhalant. Consequently, CO2 alone should not be used alone as a sole  means of euthanizing neonates. CO2 may be used to induce narcosis but must be  followed with another acceptable method of euthanasia (e.g., decapitation,  cervical dislocation, or thoracotomy) to ensure death. 14. Place animal(s) in an appropriately sized labeled leak-proof plastic carcass bag  and close/seal the bag for placement in the carcass freezer until disposal.  15. Clean area after use, and disinfect any equipment, tools and tables. 16. In case personnel should find live animals bagged for disposal (death verification  was not correctly followed) then this matter must be brought to the immediate  attention of the ACF manager, principal investigator and Attending Veterinarian. ________________________________________________________________________ References 1.
